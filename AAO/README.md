# All-at-Once approaches for model calibration

This repository provides the research code for the so-called all-at-once approaches:
- AAO-FEM (finite element-based all-at-once approach)
- AAO-VFM (virtual fields-based all-at-once approach)
- AAO-PINN (all-at-once approach using physics-informed neural networks)

All theoretical details regarding the different approaches are provided in the [related scientific publication](#related-scientific-publication).
